# unique-development

## Description
This project is set up to be a resource to train call center agents on various skills that they use every day, such as customer service and communication skills. I used Bootstrap 4 for a majority of the project.

## Custom CSS Classes

Some of the custom CSS I wrote includes:
* body
* .title
* footer
* #pageheader

## JavaScript Functions
I used JavaScript in the modals on the second and third pages and the top navigation on every page.
