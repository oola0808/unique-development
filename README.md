## Description
This project is set up to be a resource to train call center agents on various skills that they use every day, such as customer service and communication skills. I used Bootstrap 4 for a majority of the project.

## Features I Included

* A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu)
* Import Bootstrap from a CDN and use its column system to create a responsive design
* Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through

## How to View My Project
