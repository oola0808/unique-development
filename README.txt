## Description
This project is set up to be a resource to train call center agents on various skills that they use every day, such as customer service and active listening skills. I used Bootstrap 4 for a majority of the project.

## Custom CSS Classes

The classes I created are:
* #carousel_text
* .carousel1
* .carousel2
* .carousel3

## Custom JavaScript Functions
I used JavaScript in the image carousel on the landing page.
