        <p>Angelique was born and raised in the Southern Indiana area. Two of her favorite things about Unique are the
          people with whom she works and the beautiful downtown location. Angelique enjoys being outside, hiking,
          canoeing, and camping. She also enjoys reading, and has an extensive personal library that includes as many
          technical manuals as sci-fi thrillers. Angelique loves the challenges of training a head-strong dog, relaxing
          with friends and family, and spending time observing nature.</p>
